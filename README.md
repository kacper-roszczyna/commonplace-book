# KMJR commonplace-book
This is a commonplace book. The practice is inspired by this article:
https://medium.com/@neocody/how-to-become-a-philosopher-of-knowledge-101-691b9959b271

This book contains all of my knowledge, thoughts, ideas regarding study material. It contains a bibliography for each entry if it is based on factual data or any source. The idea is to accumulate a wealth of knowledge which will grow in a stable way.

How to use:

If by some sort of mirracle you arrive to find this project. I heavily suggest that you don't read selectively. This is a system of knowledge based around a number of fields and structures I made attempts to understand. By no measure am I an expert in these fields, information contained here is merely my understanding of them. 

1. Read the source material (usually a book or an article, or watch the youtube film)
2. Read the notes. They are usually a summary of key points + thoughts on them. There will be illustartions occassionally. 
3. Try to integrate this into your system of thinking or refute it based on evidence. If you find the ideas contained here refutable please make an issue detailing what is disagreeable and hopefuly I will get back to you.
