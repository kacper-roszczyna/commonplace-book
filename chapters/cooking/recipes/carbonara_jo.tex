Carbonara is a rather heavy dish, but it's perfect to whip up on a quick date when you know your partner enjoys Italian cuisine and strong tastes. Made in two variants with either cream or lack of it, the author leans towards the one without it. Without further ado.

\myparagraph{Ingredients}

2 servings \\

2 eggs
200g of bacon (in the original it's pancetta, which is a spicy version of it)
parsley
3 cloves of garlic
salt and pepper to taste
Grand Padano cheese (one of the hard aged cheeses will be good)
Spaghetti pasta

\myparagraph{Steps}

1. Mix the eggs with grated cheese. Add cheese until the mixture is creamy and thick. It's better to have too much cheese than to little.

2. Onto a warm frying pan add a little bit of olive oil and fry the garlic. 

3. Add minced parsley and diced bacon to the pan and keep frying until golden in color. 

4. In the mean time cook the pasta until it is al dente.

5. Add the pasta to the frying pan and mix until the bacon is evenly mixed throughout. Now make sure that the heat isn't too large. On small heat add the mixture from step 1 to the pan while mixing.

The food should be served hot. Cold this is pretty bad and not really something you may want to eath.

\myparagraph{Author's remarks}

One of my personal favorites. This is highly caloric so don't eat it too often.
