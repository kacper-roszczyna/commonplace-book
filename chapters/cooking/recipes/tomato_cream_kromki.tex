\myparagraph{Author's remarks}
I have encountered a very interesting twist to the classical tomato cream soup. Below I give account to the a possible recipe, though it should not be taken at word. There are two key changes to the classical tomato soup. First of all the tomatoes should not be fully blended, a little bit of courseness must be left to ensure that the soup has interesting texture. Second of all horseradish must be added to taste. This allows a much more powerful flavor and highlights the sweetness of the tomatoes. I think there was also a little bit of cream in there.
