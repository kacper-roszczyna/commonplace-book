This is a commonplace book. Basically this is a simple way of keeping track of my notes. So as when I encounter an interesting idea I can write it down, keep track of it for later. It is the entirety of my knowledge, condensed and consumed with a bibliography. If you stumble upon it, please entertain yourself.
