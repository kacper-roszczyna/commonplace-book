\myparagraph{Variable}
A place in memory which can be assigned any number of references/properties or objects repeatedly. A simpler idea is to think of a variable as a container which holds an object. That way we say that the variable references it. So it's fairly easy to see that this can be modified from multiple places.

\myparagraph{Value}
A variable that can not be modified. It is only assigned once. Safe for multithreading. Should always trump variable.
